I believe that, in the limited scope of the program's functions, a plan-driven approach would suffice.

The software has limited stakeholders. If we were to assume this is a student project, there are many
well built alternatives available with comprehensive error handling and greater capabilities and applications.

The software has room for expansion and upgrades, but I struggle to find a development cycle that can iteratively
improve the functions, capability, and application of the program. Therefore, I believe a plan-based approach would
work for the full implementation of the project.
