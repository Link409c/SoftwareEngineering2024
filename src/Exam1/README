From Exam 1, Problem 2:

Suppose you are asked to implement a software for linear algebra, that does various operations
on vectors and matrices. You are asked to implement the following functionalities:
• Creating a matrix.
• Displaying a matrix.
• Addition of two matrices.
• Multiplication of two matrices.
• Obtaining the transpose of a matrix.
• Checking if a matrix is symmetric (i.e., if a matrix is equal to its transpose).
• Computing the trace (sum of the diagonal elements) if the matrix is a square matrix.

a. Implement an object-oriented solution of the above in any programming language of your
choice.
b. Describe some test cases that you want the application to pass to ensure that the
application would run without any error.
c. Would you prefer a plan-driven or an agile method for developing the above application?
State the reason for the selection of your choice.
