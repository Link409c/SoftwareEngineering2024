     * Test Cases to detail:
     * a. Incorrect Inputs to the methods should result in thrown exceptions.
     *  1. Asymmetrical matrices should not pass the symmetry test.
     *  2. Matrices of unequal size should cause sum and product methods to throw exceptions.
     *  3. Matrices that are not square should cause trace method to throw an exception.
     * b. Correct inputs should display good results as indicated by each method header.
     *  1. This should hold true for matrices of any size, not just small ones.
     * c. The toString method of the Matrix class should create a readable and well-formatted
     *    display for the user to verify their outputs and the program functions.
     * d. The Matrix class should alert the user when attempting to create an object which
     *    has no rows or columns, and prompt them for the correct input.
